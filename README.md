# Info

This API is aimed to simplify the development of Bukkit plugins (please use Paper or any fork of Paper instead of CraftBukkit/Spigot), 
providing a lot of utilities that will make your life (and mine) easier.

### It's used in my plugins, but you can use it on your own plugins if you want, just make sure to give proper credit!
