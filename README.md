# Info

This API is aimed for novice developers who could struggle with basic Bukkit's API, and provide useful resources for them in the meanwhile.

AdriAPI simplifies some functions that could be difficult to implement in basic Bukkit's API, making them easier to understand and use.

Also, it will provide precoded methods and classes that makes you not to worry about compatibility with forks of Bukkit such as Folia.

### It's used in my plugins, but you can use it on your own plugins if you want, just make sure to give proper credit!
