An API aimed to simplify the development of Paper plugins

![Build](https://github.com/Adrigamer2950/AdriAPI/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

# Info

This API is aimed to simplify the development of Paper plugins,
providing a lot of utilities that will make your life (and mine) easier.

> [!CAUTION]
> You need Java 17+ to use this API/Plugin. If you are using a lower version consider upgrading

> [!WARNING]
> Only Minecraft 1.17 or superior is officially supported. Versions below 1.17 will not receive any support

### It's mostly used in my plugins, but you can use it on your own plugins if you want, just make sure to give proper credit!
